# Coding Interview University

> This is my progress in studying Computer Science.
> And preparation for Coding Interviews.
> 
> I will be completing the tasks and mark them as [X].
> Also, will be saving all my Notes and Code practices in the directories called Notes and Code.
>
> By the way, I remade this repo for Python !!! 
> So if you know only Python and planning to pass your interview with it. It's for you!
> I added some resourses that helped me implements some Data Structures in Python.

## Data Structures

- ### Arrays
    - Implement an automatically resizing vector.
    - [X] Description:
        - [X] [Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/arrays-OsBSF)
        - [X] [UC Berkeley CS61B - Linear and Multi-Dim Arrays (video)](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_Wp8oiO_CZZE) (Start watching from 15m 32s)

        - [X] [Jagged Arrays (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jtrQqYpt7g)
    - [X] Implementation:
        - [X] Find out about lists, tuples and sets in Python
        - [X] Learn all methods with lists 
        - [X] size() - number of items
        - [X] is_empty()
        - [X] at(index) - returns item at given index, blows up if index out of bounds
        - [X] push(item)
        - [X] insert(index, item) - inserts item at index, shifts that index's value and trailing elements to the right
        - [X] prepend(item) - can use insert above at index 0
        - [X] pop() - remove from end, return value
        - [X] delete(index) - delete item at index, shifting all trailing elements left
        - [X] remove(item) - looks for value and removes index holding it (even if in multiple places)
        - [X] find(item) - looks for value and returns first index with that value, -1 if not found
    - [X] Time
        - O(1) to add/remove at end (amortized for allocations for more space), index, or update
        - O(n) to insert/remove elsewhere
    - [X] Space
        - contiguous in memory, so proximity helps performance
        - space needed = (array capacity, which is >= n) * size of item, but even if 2n, still O(n)

- ### Linked Lists
    - [X] Description:
        - [X] [Singly Linked Lists (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/singly-linked-lists-kHhgK)
        - [X] [CS 61B - Linked Lists 1 (video)](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_htzJdKoEmO0)
        - [X] [CS 61B - Linked Lists 2 (video)](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_-c4I3gFYe3w)
    - [X] Linked List vs Arrays:
        - [X] [Core Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures-optimizing-performance/core-linked-lists-vs-arrays-rjBs9)
        - [X] [In The Real World Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures-optimizing-performance/in-the-real-world-lists-vs-arrays-QUaUd)
    - [X] [why you should avoid linked lists (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo)
    - [X] Implement (I did with tail pointer & without):
    	- [X] __str__() - returns all elements in linked list
        - [X] __len__() - returns number of data elements in list
        - [X] append(data) - adds an item at the end
        - [X] empty() - bool returns True if empty
        - [X] value_at(index) - returns the value of the nth item (starting at 0 for first)
        - [X] push_front(data) - adds an item to the front of the list
        - [X] pop_front() - remove front item and return its value
        - [X] pop_back() - removes end item and returns its value
        - [X] front() - get value of front item
        - [X] back() - get value of end item
        - [X] insert(index, data) - insert value at index, so current item at that index is pointed to by new item at index
        - [X] erase(index) - removes node at given index
        - [X] reverse() - reverses the list
    - [X] Doubly-linked List
        - [X] [Description (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/doubly-linked-lists-jpGKD)

- ### Stacks and Queues
    - [X] [PDF Princeton](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall18/cos126/lectures/CS.12.StacksQueues-2x2.pdf)
    - [X] Implement Stacks using Python
    - [X] Implement Queue using linked-list, with tail pointer:
    	- [X] print() - display all elements in queue
        - [X] enqueue(value) - adds value at position at tail
        - [X] dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
        - [X] empty()
    - [X] [Read about Circular buffer](https://medium.com/@edwin.cloud/wrapping-your-head-around-circular-buffers-e84cbf549a04)
    - [X] [More about Circular buffer/FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
    - [X] Cost:
        - a bad implementation using linked list where you enqueue at head and dequeue at tail would be O(n)
            because you'd need the next to last element, causing a full traversal each dequeue
        - enqueue: O(1) (amortized, linked list and array [probing])
        - dequeue: O(1) (linked list and array)
        - empty: O(1) (linked list and array)

## Graphs

Взять чисто теорию что такое графы (посмотрев лекции Скиены) и примерно понять как реализовывать их на питоне (может даже и без этого) а еще узнать про Джекстру!! обязательно и тоже на питоне писать плюс BFS и DFS. Но в подробности сильно не вдаваться и заадчи не решать. Это уже оставить на потом на далекое будущее главное просто понять концепт

- ### Dynamic Programming

   оставить на потом на далекое будущее не вдавать пока в это все

    - You probably won't see any dynamic programming problems in your interview, but it's worth being able to recognize a problem as being a candidate for dynamic programming.
    - This subject can be pretty difficult, as each DP soluble problem must be defined as a recursion relation, and coming up with it can be tricky.
    - I suggest looking at many examples of DP problems until you have a solid understanding of the pattern involved.

## System Design, Scalability, Data Handling

**You can expect system design questions if you have 4+ years of experience.**

- Scalability and System Design are very large topics with many topics and resources, since
      there is a lot to consider when designing a software/hardware system that can scale.
      Expect to spend quite a bit of time on this
- Considerations:
    - Scalability
        - Distill large data sets to single values
        - Transform one data set to another
        - Handling obscenely large amounts of data
    - System design
        - features sets
        - interfaces
        - class hierarchies
        - designing a system under certain constraints
        - simplicity and robustness
        - tradeoffs
        - performance analysis and optimization

    - flow:
        1. Understand the problem and scope:
            - Define the use cases, with interviewer's help
            - Suggest additional features
            - Remove items that interviewer deems out of scope
            - Assume high availability is required, add as a use case
        2. Think about constraints:
            - Ask how many requests per month
            - Ask how many requests per second (they may volunteer it or make you do the math)
            - Estimate reads vs. writes percentage
            - Keep 80/20 rule in mind when estimating
            - How much data written per second
            - Total storage required over 5 years
            - How much data read per second
        3. Abstract design:
            - Layers (service, data, caching)
            - Infrastructure: load balancing, messaging
            - Rough overview of any key algorithm that drives the service
            - Consider bottlenecks and determine solutions

## Coding Question Practice

Now that you know all the computer science topics above, it's time to practice answering coding problems.

**Coding question practice is not about memorizing answers to programming problems.**

Why you need to practice doing programming problems:
- Problem recognition, and where the right data structures and algorithms fit in
- Gathering requirements for the problem
- Talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview
- Coding on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer
- Coming up with time and space complexity for your solutions
- Testing your solutions

There is a great intro for methodical, communicative problem solving in an interview. You'll get this from the programming
interview books, too, but I found this outstanding:
[Algorithm design canvas](http://www.hiredintech.com/algorithm-design/)

No whiteboard at home? That makes sense. I'm a weirdo and have a big whiteboard. Instead of a whiteboard, pick up a
large drawing pad from an art store. You can sit on the couch and practice. This is my "sofa whiteboard".
I added the pen in the photo for scale. If you use a pen, you'll wish you could erase. Gets messy quick. I use a pencil
and eraser.
